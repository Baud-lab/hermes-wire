HERMES-WIRE (HERitable MicrobiomE Structure — Workflow for Interpreting host–microbiome Relationships &amp; Effects) is a modular suite of Nextflow pipelines that fuse cost-effective quantitative genetics with systems biology to map how host polygenic variation wires gut microbial community structure and model their causal impacts on metabolic health.
