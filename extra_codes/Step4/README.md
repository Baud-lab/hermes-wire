# 🔍 Step 4 extra codes

Here you find the folder `codes`, containing a main bash script describing how to improve and validate an initial SEM model (`sem_feedforward.sh`) and its accessory R script (`sem_feedforward.R`), using an initial SEM model on folder `input/` (`my_model.lav`). This represents a task to be performed after running the Step4 pipeline.
