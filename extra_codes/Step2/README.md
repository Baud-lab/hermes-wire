# 🔍 Step 2 extra codes

In the `codes` folder you are going to find a main R script named `characterization_heritable.R`, which is the additional script containing the biggest part of the parallel analyses performed based on Step2 inputs and outputs.
Run this code using the command line:

```
Rscript characterization_heritable.R \
  --input_tsv filtered_VCs.tsv \
  --outpdf ../Results/characterization_heritable.pdf \
  --subset_id "Full cohort"
```

Furthermore, in `code/not_reviewed` you find extra codes generated for thesis <i>Host genetics shapes mucin niche colonisation by keystone gut bacteria, influencing metabolic health</i> (Dias, FMS; 2025 - <b>Yet to be published</b>) that are being revised in order to be in their best sharable versions.
